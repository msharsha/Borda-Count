> This project is to build a website to implement borda count.  Itâ€™s a method of aggregating individual preferences into a social preference.  An administrator creates an event, which is a choice among K objects (e.g. times for a meeting). N different users then rank the K objects, and the website uses the Borda Count to deliver the top choice. Extensions use other algorithms also, like bidding with points.

>The application implements the aggregation algorithm and a Python Django application for the users to submit their choice. Stakeholders for this project are Dr. Korok Ray, Dr. Duncan Walker.
